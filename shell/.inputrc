#These will make completions appear immediately after pressing TAB once, instead
#of the default behavior which is to show them after pressing twice. I think
#you'll find this saves you many unnecessary keystrokes, but the potential
#downside is that it could take up the space of terminal backlog you were
#intending on keeping visible.

#With this enabled, underscores and hyphens are treated equally when completing,
#which is a plus to me because I find hyphens a lot easier to type.
set completion-map-case on

#This one is insanely useful when you have a folder with lots of similarly named
#files and you are not sure how far the completion has gone when you press TAB.
#The first part that has been completed will be replaced by "...", and it is
#simple to see what you need to type to finish the completion.
